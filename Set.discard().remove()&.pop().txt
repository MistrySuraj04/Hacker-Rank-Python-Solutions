TASK :- 		
	You have a non-empty set , and you have to execute  commands given in  lines.
	The commands will be pop, remove and discard.

	Input Format :-
	1. The first line contains integer n, the number of elements in the set s.
	2. The second line contains n space separated elements of set s. 
		All of the elements are non-negative integers, less than or equal to 9.
	3. The third line contains integer N, the number of commands.
	4. The next N lines contains either pop, remove and/or discard commands followed by their 
		associated value.

    # Checking for command type to be 'remove'.
    # Using list indexing to access the command string in list at index 0.

        # Using discard() python set function to remove value from set.
        set_value.discard(int(command[1]))
    
    # Is the command is neither 'remove' or 'discard' then it's pop.
    else:
