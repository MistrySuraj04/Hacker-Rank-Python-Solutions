TASK :- 		
	Read in two integers, a and b, and print three lines.
	The first line is the integer division a//b 
	(While using Python2 remember to import division from __future__).
	The second line is the result of the modulo operator: a%b.
	The third line prints the divmod of a and b.

	Input Format :-
	The first line contains the first integer, a, and the second line contains 
		the second integer, b.


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# Taking and storing the dividend and divisor values as input from user.
dividend = int(input())
divisor = int(input())

# Printing int division of dividend and divisor in first line.
# int division returns the quotient value of division.
print(dividend // divisor)

# Printing modulo division of dividend and divisor in second line.
# modulo operator return the remainder value of division.
print(dividend % divisor)

# Printing the divmod value of dividend and divisor in third line.
# The divmod() is python built-in math module function which return a tuple of quotient and remainder 
# value when two input values are passed in the function.
print(divmod(dividend, divisor))
