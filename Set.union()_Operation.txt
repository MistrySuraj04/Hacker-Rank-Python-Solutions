TASK :- 		
	The students of District College have subscriptions to English and French newspapers. 
	Some students have subscribed only to English, some have subscribed to only French and some 
	have subscribed to both newspapers.

	You are given two sets of student roll numbers. One set has subscribed to the English 
	newspaper, and the other set is subscribed to the French newspaper. The same student could 
	be in both sets. Your task is to find the total number of students who have subscribed to at 
	least one newspaper.


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# Taking set_a length user input.
set_a_len = input()

# Storing user input set_a values into a variable. 
set_a = set(input().split())

# Taking set_b length user input.
set_b_len = input()

# Storing user input set_b values into a variable. 
set_b = set(input().split())

# Here we have used set() python in-built data conversion function to change input data type from 
# list to set as we are using split() another python in-built function to seperate the input and 
# convert it into list.

# Using union() pyton in-built set function to merge both the set values and create a new set with 
# unique values of both the sets.
set_union = set_a.union(set_b)

# Using len() python in-built function to determine the number of elements in an iterable input.
set_union_len = len(set_union)

# Printing the set union length.
print(set_union_len)
