TASK :- 		
	You are given two sets, A and B.
	Your job is to find whether set A is a subset of set B.

	If set A is subset of set B, print True.
	If set A is not a subset of set B, print False.

	Input Format :- 
	1. The first line will contain the number of test cases, T.
	2. The first line of each test case contains the number of elements in set A.
	3. The second line of each test case contains the space separated elements of set A.
	4. The third line of each test case contains the number of elements in set B.
	5. The fourth line of each test case contains the space separated elements of set B.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# Taking the test cases count from user as input.

# Uisng For loop to iterate through the sequence of test_cases_count created with the help of 
# range() python in-built function which takes in int as input and returns sequence starting with 0 
# and ending with one values less than input.
for _ in range(test_cases_count):
    
    # Taking in the length of first set as input from user.
    set_a_len = int(input())

    # Using split() python in-built function to split the string and convert it into list of strings.
    # Using map() python function to change data type of input value to int.
    # Using set() python data conversion function to convert the list of input value into set data type.
