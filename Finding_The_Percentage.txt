TASK :- 		
	The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of 
	name:[marks] for a list of students. Print the average of the marks array for the student 
	name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

	EXAMPLE :-
		marks key:value pairs are
		'alpha': [20,30,40]
		'beta': [30,50,70]
		query_name = 'beta'
