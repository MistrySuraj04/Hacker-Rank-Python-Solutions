TASK :- 		
	ABC is a right triangle, 90° at B.
	Therefore, ∠ABC 90°.
	Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC.
	You are given the lengths AB and BC.
	Your task is to find ∠MBC (angle Θ°, as shown in the figure) in degrees.

	Input Format :-
	The first line contains the length of side .
	The second line contains the length of side .


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Importing python math module.
import math

# Taking and storing lenght of two sides of triangle as input from user.
length_ab = int(input())
length_bc = int(input())

# Calculating the value of hypotenuse using hypot() python built-in math module function which 
# outputs the hypotenuse lenght of triangle when length of other two sides of triangle are passed 
# as parameter.
hypotenuse = math.hypot(length_ab, length_bc)

# Finding out the angle from metting of two input triangle sides to hypotenuse.
# round() is a python built-in function which returns a floating point value which is the 
# rounded version.
# degrees() is a python built-in math module function which is used to convert the input angle from 
# radian to degree.
# acos() is a python built-in math module function which returns the arc cosine value of number.
angle = round(math.degrees(math.acos(length_bc/hypotenuse)))

# In degree we have stores the degree symbol.
# chr() is a python built-in function which return a string which represents respective input unicode.
degree = chr(176)

# Printing the angle and degree symbol with seperator as none.
print(angle,degree, sep='')
