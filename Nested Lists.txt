TASK :- 		
	Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested 
	list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

	Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names 
	alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

	Example :- 
		records = [["chi",20.0],["bet",50.0],["alpha",50.0]]

	The ordered list of scores is [20.0,50.0], so the second lowest score is 50.0. There are two 
	students with that score: . Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:

	Output :- 
		alpha
		beta
