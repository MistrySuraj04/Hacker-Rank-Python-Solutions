TASK :- 		
	Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. 
	The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not 
	exist in both.

	Input Format :-
	1. The first line of input contains an integer, M.
	2. The second line contains M space-separated integers.
	3. The third line contains an integer, N.
	4. The fourth line contains N space-separated integers.


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# Taking in the length of first set as input from user.
set_a_len = int(input())

# Using split() python in-built function to split the string and convert it into 
# list of strings.
# Using map() python function to change data type of input value to int.
# Using set() python data conversion function to convert the list of input value 
# into set data type.
set_a = set(map(int, input().split()))

# Taking in the length of first set as input from user.
set_b_len = int(input())
set_b = set(map(int, input().split()))

# Using symmetric_difference() pyton in-built set function to find out the uncommon value in 
# both the sets.
set_symmetric_difference = set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b)

# Converting the result set of symmetric difference into list to be sorted later.
# Using sort() python function to sort the list in ascending order.
set_list = sorted(set_symmetric_difference)
set_list.sort()

# Using For loop to iterate thorugh the sorted resultant list.
for value in set_list:
    
    # Printing the value in list every iteration.
    print(value)
