TASK :- 		
	There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing 
	m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. 
	Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if i∈A, you add 1 to your 
	happiness. If i∈B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. 
	Output your final happiness at the end.

	Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain 
	duplicate elements.

	Input Format :-
	The first line contains integers n and m separated by a space.
	The second line contains n integers, the elements of the array.
	The third and fourth lines contain m integers, A and B, respectively


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# Taking and storing length of both the sets which will be input from user.
_ = input()

# Taking and storing set_a values from user and converting it into list as there is a possibility of 
# duplicate values.
set_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Taking and storing values of other two disjoint sets as input from user.
other_set_a = set(map(int, input().split()))
other_set_b = set(map(int, input().split()))

# Creating a variable to store the happiness count.
happiness = 0
    
# Looping through the elements of set_a.
for element in set_a:
    
    # Using conditional statement to alter the execution flow and execute code accordingly as per the 
    # value matches in disjoint sets.
    if element in other_set_a:
        
        # If element value is there is other_set_a which is like set then incrementing the value of 
	# happiness count by 1.
        happiness += 1
        
    elif element in other_set_b:
        
        # If element value is there is other_set_a which is dislike set then decrementing the value of 
	# happiness count by 1.
        happiness -= 1
        
# After performing all the operations printing the happiness count.
print(happiness)
