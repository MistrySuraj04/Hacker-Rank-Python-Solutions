TASK :- 		
	Apply your knowledge of the .add() operation to help your friend Rupal.

	Rupal has a huge collection of country stamps. She decided to count the total number of 
	distinct country stamps in her collection. She asked for your help. You pick the stamps one 
	by one from a stack of N country stamps.

	Find the total number of distinct country stamps.


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# Declaring variable to store stamp country names in list.
stamp_country_set = set()

# Taking in the count of stamps from the user.
stamp_count = int(input())

# Using For loop to iterate through the sequence of stamp_count using range() python in-built 
# function which generates sequence for input integer value.
for stamp_country in range(stamp_count):
    
    # Storing input stamp country name in list.
    stamp_country_set.add(input())


# Using len() python in-built function to determine the count of elements in the specified iterable 
# input value which is set in this case.
distinct_stamp_count = len(stamp_country_set)

# Printing out the distinct stamp count.
print(distinct_stamp_count)
