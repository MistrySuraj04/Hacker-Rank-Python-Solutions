TASK :- 		
	Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

	1. insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
	2. print: Print the list.
	3. remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
	4. append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
	5. sort: Sort the list.
	6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
	7. reverse: Reverse the list.
	Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each 
	command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform 
	the corresponding operation on your list
