TASK :- 		
	You are given a set A and n other sets.
	Your job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets.
	Print True, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.
	A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.
	
	Example :-
	Set ([1,3,4]) is a strict superset of set([1,3]).
	Set ([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set([1,3,4]).
	Set ([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set([1,3,5]).

	Input Format :-
	The first line contains the space separated elements of set A.
	The second line contains integer n, the number of other sets.
	The next n lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.
