TASK :- 		
	You are given a string S.
	Your task is to find out whether S is a valid regex or not.

	Input Format :-
	The first line contains integer T, the number of test cases.
	The next T lines contains the string S.


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Importing re python regex library.
import re

# Taking number of test cases count from user and storing it in variable.
regex_test_count = int(input())

# Using For loop to iterate through the sequence of regex_test_count which is created with the help of 
# range() python in-built function which is used to return iterable sequence when int input is passed.
for _ in range(regex_test_count):
    
    # Creating a bool variable to store result of regex.
    is_valid_regex = False
    
    # Try block.
    try:
        
        # Taking and storing the regex as input from the user.
        regex = str(input())
        
        # Using compile() python re library function to compile the passed regex as input to verify if 
	# it is valid or not.
        re.compile(regex)
        
        # Storing True as value in bool variable if regex compiles successfully.
        is_valid_regex = True
    
        # Except block.
    except:
        
        # Storing False as value in bool variable if regex compiles with error.
        is_valid_regex = False
        
    # Printing the bool value for every regex passed.
    print(is_valid_regex)
