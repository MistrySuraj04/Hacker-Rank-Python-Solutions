TASK :- 		
	Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers X,Y and Z representing 
	the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer N. You have to print a list of all possible 
	coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to N. Here, 
	0<=i<=X; 0<=j<=Y; 0<=k<=Z


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # input() is in-built python function which helps developer store user input.
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    z = int(input())
    n = int(input())
    
    # Creating a variable to store permutations in list format.
    output_list = []
    
    # Looping through the sequence of x including x input.
    for num1 in range(x+1):
        
        # Looping through the sequence of y including y input.
        for num2 in range(y+1):
            
            # Looping through the sequence of z including z input.
            for num3 in range(z+1):
                
                # Using conditional statement to check for the sum of all the three numbers.
                # If sum of all three numbers is equal to fourth input then pass.
                if num1 + num2 + num3 == n:
                    continue
                
                # If sum of all three numbers is not equal to n the fourth input the create a 
		# permutation and append it into the output_list.
                else:
                    # Building up permutation in desired format.
                    permutation = [num1, num2, num3]
                    
                    # Using append() python list function to add permutation value into the 
		    # list variable.
                    output_list.append(permutation)

    # Printing out the output_list containing all the permutations.
    print(output_list)

BONUS :- 
# Solution in real one liner list comprehension way :-
output_list = [[num1, num2, num3] for num1 in range(x+1) for num2 in range(y+1) for num3 in range(z+1) if num1 + num2 + num3 != n]
