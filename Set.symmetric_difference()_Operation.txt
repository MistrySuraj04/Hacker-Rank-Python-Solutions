TASK :- 		
	Students of District College have subscriptions to English and French newspapers. 
	Some students have subscribed to English only, some have subscribed to French only, 
	and some have subscribed to both newspapers.

	You are given two sets of student roll numbers. One set has subscribed to the English 
	newspaper, and one set has subscribed to the French newspaper. Your task is to find the 
	total number of students who have subscribed to either the English or the French newspaper 
	but not both.


********************************************** SOLUTION **********************************************

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# Taking set_a length user input.
set_a_len = input()

# Storing user input set_a values into a variable. 
set_a = set(input().split())

# Taking set_b length user input.
set_b_len = input()

# Storing user input set_b values into a variable. 
set_b = set(input().split())

# Here we have used set() python in-built data conversion function to change input data type from 
# list to set as we are using split() another python in-built function to seperate the input and 
# convert it into list.

# Using symmetric_difference() pyton in-built set function to find out the uncommon value in both 
# the sets.
set_symmetric_difference = set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b)

# Using len() python in-built function to determine the number of elements in an iterable input.
set_symmetric_difference_len = len(set_symmetric_difference)

# Printing the set union length.
print(set_symmetric_difference_len)
